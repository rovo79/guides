Ember CLI, Ember's command line interface, provides a standard project
structure, a set of development tools, and an addon system.
This allows Ember developers to focus on building apps rather
than building the support structures that make them run.
From your command line, a quick `ember --help` shows
the commands Ember CLI provides. For more information on a specific command,
type `ember help <command-name>`.
